# Flim Flowers

This is an interactive data visualization project created with p5.js to display historical box office data from China.

It's also a recreation of the project **"Film Flowers"** by data visualization designer **Shirley Wu**. Yes, I didn't even change the name!

I've been learning p5.js for a couple of days, and this is my first practice project, so it was undoubtedly made with a lot of help from AI -- this time is Gemini 2.5Pro. Thank you Gemini! ( By the way I am gemini too! )

I added some new interactions to this version. For example, when you hover over a flower, it spins, and its information appears below. If you click on a flower, it will take you to its page on Douban.com, China's largest online film community.

Have fun!
